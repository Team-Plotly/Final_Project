What do we hope to achieve?
Utilizing the BLS Employment Wages – we want to determine the location based if there are any income disparity based on geographic location.  Spikes in locations to determine population overall, and other factors. 
Large based on counties and specifics - Determine inequality of BLS Employment wages based on County (FIPS)

Reason Why
Is there an unbiased subset regarding population?  Census data has great quality of data and openly available.  By comparing and contrasting data by county we want to dive in and verify differences in variable factors that may contribute to poverty or lower income.

Description of the source data
Four tables by County level for poverty, population, unemployment / Median Household Income, and Education  (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/)

Questions we hope to answer with the data:
Putting together a visual representation of income across the states (map and bar graph) as an introduction and then saying we are exploring further by diving into county level avg incomes , population, education, unemployment rate, % of people in poverty and gender (% of men). We can then see which factors to include in the final model by checking correlation values and then run regression to create a model that can predict avg incomes in a county as the factors change in the future.

## Machine Learning Model (based on Rubric)
Putting together a visual representation of income across the states (map and bar graph) as an introduction and exploring further by diving into county level avg incomes , population, education, unemployment rate, % of people in poverty and gender (% of men). We can then see which factors to include in the final model by checking correlation values and then run regression to create a model that can predict avg incomes in a county as the factors change in the future.
