# Final Project Week 1 Submission - Team Plotly

## Topic

What do we hope to achieve?
Utilizing the County level census data, we want to determine if there are any income disparity based on geographic location. We will be then try to identify what factors affect the disparity and if we can predict the average incomes in the future.

Reason Why?
Census data has great quality of data and openly available.  By comparing and contrasting data by county we want to dive in and verify differences in variable factors that may contribute to poverty or lower income.

Description of the source data
Four tables by County level for poverty, population, unemployment / Median Household Income, and Education  (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/)

Questions we hope to answer with the data:
1) Is there an income disparity?
2) What are the factors affecting the income disparity?
3) Can we predict income based on these factors?


## GitHub

1. Master Branch created and all team members have joined
2. Description of communication protocols
  - Meeting on Wednesday during course breakout rooms
  - Mostly online and shared personal communication (email)
  - Slack channel setup with team members
  - Notifications on each person’s devices and workstations
3. Individual Branches
  - All Setup and verified

## Machine Learning Model

Putting together a visual representation of income across the states (map and bar graph) as an introduction and exploring further by diving into county level avg incomes , population, education, unemployment rate, % of people in poverty and gender (% of men). We can then see which factors to include in the final model by checking correlation values and then run regression to create a model that can predict avg incomes in a county as the factors change in the future.
